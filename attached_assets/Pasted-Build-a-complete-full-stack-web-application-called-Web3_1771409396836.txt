Build a complete full-stack web application called Web3D Bookmark Visualizer.

The application should allow users to save bookmarks (title, URL, category) and visualize them in an interactive 3D environment inside the browser.

Use the following tech stack:

Frontend: React (Vite)

3D Rendering: Three.js

Backend: Node.js + Express

Database: MongoDB with Mongoose

🔹 BACKEND REQUIREMENTS

Create a REST API with proper MVC structure:

Bookmark Schema:
{
title: { type: String, required: true },
url: { type: String, required: true },
category: { type: String, required: true },
createdAt: { type: Date, default: Date.now }
}

API Endpoints:

POST /api/bookmarks → Add bookmark

GET /api/bookmarks → Get all bookmarks

PUT /api/bookmarks/:id → Update bookmark

DELETE /api/bookmarks/:id → Delete bookmark

Include:

Error handling

CORS

Environment variables

Clean folder structure

🔹 FRONTEND REQUIREMENTS

Create a React application with:

A form to add new bookmarks (title, URL, category)

A 3D canvas area

Three.js Scene:

PerspectiveCamera

AmbientLight + DirectionalLight

WebGLRenderer

OrbitControls (zoom + rotate)

3D Visualization Logic:

Fetch bookmarks from backend

Render each bookmark as a 3D cube

Color cubes based on category

Group bookmarks by category in clusters

Display bookmark title as text label above cube

Interaction:

Raycasting for click detection

On cube click → open bookmark URL in new tab

Hover animation (scale up slightly)

Smooth render loop animation

🔹 ARCHITECTURE REQUIREMENTS

Separate components:

BookmarkForm.jsx

ThreeScene.jsx

API service file

Reusable function: renderBookmarks(data)

Clean, modular, well-commented code

Production-ready structure

🔹 UI REQUIREMENTS

Modern minimal UI

Responsive layout

Dark theme

Loading state while fetching bookmarks

🔹 BONUS FEATURES

Search bar to filter bookmarks

Camera smoothly moves toward selected bookmark

Animation when new bookmark is added

Provide:

Full folder structure

All required dependencies

Setup instructions

Complete working code

Comments explaining important parts

The code should be suitable for a final-year major project and easy to explain in a viva.
